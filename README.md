What's are pseudobots?

Attackers on the Internet control large number of victim computers by installing a botnet client and have them connect to a Command and Control server (C2). Pseudobots are fake botnet clients that you can have connect to a C2 server. Unlike real botnet clients, pseudobots don't carry out attacks when instructed. Pseudobots contain no malicious code.

Why operate pseudobots?

As the operators of botnets (botherders) don't know that pseudobots aren't real, they will still instruct the pseudobots to perform various actions, such as to attack a site or network. Identifying the targets of a botnet allow researchers to guess at the motives and intent of the botherders.
